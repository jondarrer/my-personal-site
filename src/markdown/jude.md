```BiblePassage
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.

To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ.

Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.

Dear brothers, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith once and for all entrusted to God's holy people.
```

[Jude 1-3 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude&version=NIVUK)
