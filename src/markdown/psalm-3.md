# Psalm 3

![](/images/psalm-3.jpg)

```BiblePassage
Lord, how many are my foes!
    How many rise up against me!
Many are saying of me,
    "God will not deliver him"

But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
    my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
I call out to the Lord,
    and he answers me from His holy mountain.

I lie down and sleep;
    I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
I will not fear though tens of thousands
    assail me from every side.

Arise, Lord!
    Deliver me my God!
Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
    break the teeth of the wicked.

From the Lord comes deliverance.
    May your blessing be on Your people.
```
