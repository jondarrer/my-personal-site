## A change is as good as a break

I've found that moving location while working from home has improved my focus. I
spend the majority of my day working from my living room. It's lovely, and I
have a nice view out onto my front garden. I have a sit/stand desk, which has
reduced back pain and improved my stamina. When I have a long meeting that I may
not need to actively participate in, I take a walk in my local park and either
just listen, or watch on my phone. And around tea-time, when I don't have any
more Zoom calls, I move to the spare bedroom and work from there, which has
improved my ability to concentrate for longer. It's also where my wife works and
it's nice to be with her üòç.
