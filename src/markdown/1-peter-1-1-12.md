```BiblePassage
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

To God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provices of Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Asia and Bythinia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obediant to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood:

Grace and peace be yours in abundance.

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that cannot perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. Those have come about so that the proven genuiness of your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes though refined by fire - may result in praise, glory and honour, when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him you love him, and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are recieving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
